In React Native, when working with FlatList and its keyExtractor prop, providing an incorrect key can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering, slow performance, or crashes. The key should uniquely identify each item in the data array.  Common mistakes include using index as the key or using keys that are not unique, like object IDs that are not guaranteed to be unique. Consider using a UUID or a unique identifier provided by your backend for data items.
